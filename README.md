üèõ About ROTA_MVC

ROTA_MVC is a C# / ASP.NET MVC (or similar MVC-pattern) web application framework / project scaffold (or domain app) designed to support [describe your domain responsibilities ‚Äî e.g. route management, rota scheduling, resource assignment, shift planning, etc.].

It blends Model-View-Controller architectural principles with domain logic aimed at solving problems around rota / scheduling / assignment workflows (or whatever "ROTA" stands for in your usage).

üéØ Objectives & Use Cases

Provide a robust, maintainable foundation for building rota / scheduling / resource management applications

Enforce clean separation of concerns: domain logic in Models / Services, presentation in Views, routing / orchestration in Controllers

Support extensibility (adding new domain modules, different scheduling rules, integration with external services)

Enable maintainability and clean testing (unit testing, integration testing)

Optionally expose APIs for frontends or external consumers

üß± Architecture & Technology Stack

From repository character:

Primary language: C# (backend / domain)

Web UI: HTML + CSS + likely Razor views / MVC Views

Possible JavaScript for interactivity (lightweight or SPA elements)

Uses the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern for structuring responsibilities

Project is organized as a solution (.sln) ‚Äî implying multiple projects or layers (UI, domain, data access)

üí° Why It Exists

Many rota / scheduling systems are rigid or bespoke; ROTA_MVC aims to be modular and reusable across contexts

It helps you avoid boilerplate and architectural drift when building new scheduling features

It gives you a starting point that enforces discipline (separation, DI, clear layers) so future maintenance or scale is easier

üöÄ Key Features (possible / intended)

CRUD operations for rota entities (shifts, employees, assignments)

Scheduling logic or rules engine (constraints, overlap checks, availability)

UI views for managing, visualizing, editing rotas

Potential API endpoints for consumption by frontend or mobile clients

Validation, error handling, transactional consistency
